Energy Conservation Calculator

Task: Create a program to calculate the kinetic and potential energy of an object. Given the mass, velocity, and height, 
compute the total mechanical energy and verify the conservation of energy in different scenarios.


Develop a library that incoorporates the necessary functions or classes to perform essential calculations required by users. 
Also submit a document file about the things you learned while doing the task( be it mathematics, logic or even code syntax ).

Documentation is mandatory regardless of whether the task is completed.If the task is not completed, provide a detailed explanation of the technical 
reasons or challenges that prevented its completion.
